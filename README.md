# Fischer Random Piece Order Generator

>Fischerrandom is chess with all the back rank pieces all jumbled and scrambled and crazy like. The only three rules are that the king has to be between the rooks, the bishops must be on opposite colored squares, and the two sides have to be exactly symmetrically the same! Make the output something like "RBNNKRQB" indicating the white back rank. You dont need the black because it is just a mirror of white on the other side of the board. If you wanted to get real fancy you could associate each value with a picture of the corresponding piece and output a fancy piece array. *edit added rule about opposite colored bishops
